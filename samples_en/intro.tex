The organization of successful events, encompassing personal, corporate, or social contexts, necessitates careful planning and effective oversight of various details. Nonetheless, this process frequently becomes unwieldy owing to the presence of disjointed tools and manual coordination activities. This thesis advocates for the creation of a novel \textbf{Event Management System} designed to enhance and facilitate the event planning process.

The suggested system aims to encompass the complete lifecycle of events, ranging from their inception to their execution, while tackling significant obstacles encountered by both event organizers and participants. Through the provision of an intuitive interface, this system will facilitate event creators in the seamless management of critical information such as dates, venues, and participant lists. Furthermore, robust authentication procedures and role-based access controls will safeguard data integrity and guarantee suitable user permissions.

The principal characteristics of the system encompass real-time notifications designed to keep users updated, sophisticated search and filtering options to locate pertinent events, and RSVP functionalities for monitoring participation. Furthermore, the incorporation of analytics and reporting instruments will equip organizers with actionable insights, including attendee demographics and engagement metrics, thus promoting data-driven decision-making.

This thesis examines the development of a scalable, efficient, and accessible web-based solution designed to enhance event management and simultaneously elevate the user experience. The primary objective is to convert event planning into a smooth and engaging experience for both organizers and participants.
