\section{Future Work}

As we continue to enhance the Eventastic platform, several key areas have been identified for future development:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{User Experience Enhancements:} We aim to improve the overall user experience by implementing more intuitive navigation and interactive elements. This includes refining the event creation process and enhancing the search functionality to allow users to filter events more effectively.
    
    \item \textbf{Mobile Responsiveness:} While the current design is functional on mobile devices, we plan to optimize the layout and interactions specifically for mobile users to ensure a seamless experience across all devices.
    
    \item \textbf{Integration with Third-Party Services:} Future updates will include integrations with popular third-party services such as social media platforms for event sharing, payment gateways for ticket purchases, and email marketing tools to help organizers promote their events.
    
    \item \textbf{Advanced Analytics Dashboard:} We plan to develop an analytics dashboard for event organizers, providing insights into ticket sales, attendee demographics, and engagement metrics. This will help organizers make data-driven decisions to improve their events.
    
    \item \textbf{Enhanced Security Features:} As user data is paramount, we will focus on implementing additional security measures, including two-factor authentication and improved data encryption protocols to protect user information.
    
    \item \textbf{Community Features:} To foster a sense of community, we will explore adding features such as user profiles, event reviews, and discussion forums where attendees can interact before and after events.
    
    \item \textbf{Accessibility Improvements:} We are committed to making Eventastic accessible to all users, including those with disabilities. Future work will focus on adhering to accessibility standards and guidelines to ensure everyone can use the platform effectively.
    
    \item \textbf{Performance Optimization:} Continuous performance monitoring and optimization will be a priority to ensure fast load times and a smooth user experience, especially as the user base grows.
